# paper-replication

Repository for ML paper replication projects. The purpose of this repo is to implement paper with the engineering best
practices.

# Structure

What should

* Basic implementation
* Adding tests
* Adding documentations
* Adding demo application
* Adding experimentation framework support ([Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/))
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Adding model observability
* Implement different optimization techniques and track
