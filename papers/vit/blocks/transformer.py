"""
Transformer Encoder - The Transformer Encoder, is a collection of the layers listed above.
There are two skip connections inside the Transformer encoder (the "+" symbols) meaning the layers's inputs are fed
directly to immediate layers as well as subsequent layers. The overall ViT architecture is comprised of a number of
Transformer encoders stacked on top of eachother.
